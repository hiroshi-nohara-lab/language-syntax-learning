// Getting started with hello world
fn main() {
    // this is here is a rust macor i don't know what macro is at the moment
    //  but if it would have been a function it would have been called without ! , so more like println("hello world")
    //  the only thing to keep in mind for now is that functions and macros are different
    println!("Hello, world!")
}

// anatomy of a rust program
// the  main function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
